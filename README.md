# Pokermon
Huge thank you to [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) and [Cryptid](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid).
This mod would not be possible otherwise. 

Pokermon is a full content mod for Balatro, adding content based on Pokemon. There are 152 new Jokers, 10 new Tarot cards and 3 new Spectral cards currently implemented.
There is also a new option to only play with Pokemon Jokers if you want to focus on the new content. (Option defaults to off)

Please note this is my first mod and a work in progress so there may be quite a few bugs and crashes. Please report any to me so I can hopefully fix them.

**Prerequisites:**

Both [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) (use v0.5.0-beta6, v0.5.0-beta7 currently crashes with my code) and [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) (use 1.0.0 version) must be installed.

**Installation:**

1. Download the zip file with the contents of the repository. (Code -> Download Zip)\
2. Create a folder named Pokermon inside your mods folder.
3. Extract the zip file and place all files in this respository (minus the license and readme files) inside the Pokermon folder.
4. Make sure the files are directly under the Pokermon folder in your mods folder and not under the zip file folder.
   (In other words, unzip the file and then copy and paste the assests, config.lua, pokermon.lua, etc to be under the Pokermon folder in the mods folder) 

**Roadmap:**

In the immediate future, I would like to polish and fine tune the Gen I Pokemon along with bug fixing. 
In the near future, I would like to implement challenges based on Gym leaders and a new consumable type, TMs.
Farther out in the future, I would like to implement additional generations of Pokemon Jokers.

**Card Images:**

Right now the cards just have the offical Pokemon art pasted on top of the card as I am not really an artist. I'd love to have the card art fit more with Balatro. 
If you'd like to contribute any card designs I would really appreciate it. Of course I'd be sure to credit you here in this readme file and via tooltip on the Joker itself.
