# Pokermon
Huge thank you to [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) and [Cryptid](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid).
This mod would not be possible otherwise. 

Pokermon is a full content mod for Balatro, adding content based on Pokemon. There are 152 new Jokers, 10 new Tarot cards and 3 new Spectral cards currently implemented.
There is also a new option to only play with Pokemon Jokers if you want to focus on the new content. (Option defaults to off)

Please note this is my first mod and a work in progress so there may be quite a few bugs and crashes. Please report any to me so I can hopefully fix them.

Prerequisites:
Both [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) must be installed.

Installation:
1. Create a folder named Pokermon inside your mods folder.
2. Place all files in this respository (minus the license and readme files) inside the Pokermon folder.

Roadmap:
In the immdiate future, I would like to polish and fine tune the Gen I pokemon along with bug fixing. 
In the near future, I would like to implement challenges based on Gym leaders and maybe a few vouchers. 
Farther out in the future, I would like to implement additional generations of Pokemon Jokers.

Card images:
Right now the cards just have the offical Pokemon art pasted on top of the card as I am not really an artist. I'd love to have the card art fit more with Balatro. 
If you'd like to contribute any card designs I would really appreciate it. Of course I'd be sure to credit you here in this readme file and via tooltip on the Joker itself.
